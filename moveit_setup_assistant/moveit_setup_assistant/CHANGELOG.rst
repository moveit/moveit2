* Minimize use of `this->` (`#1784 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1784>`_)
  It's often unnecessary. MoveIt already avoids this in most cases
  so this PR better cements that existing pattern.

* Use <> for non-local headers (`#1734 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1734>`_)
  Unless a header lives in the same or a child directory of the file
  including it, it's recommended to use <> for the #include statement.

  Adaption of https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/3106
* banish bind()
  source:https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/3106/commits/a2911c80c28958c1fce8fb52333d770248c4ec05; required minor updates compared to original source commit in order to ensure compatibility with ROS2

  This is a function specific to the SimulationWidget
* Provide button to open original URDF file
* Fix widget layout
* Use focusGiven() + focusLost() to generate and validate Gazebo URDF
* XmlSyntaxHighlighter: allow nested highlighting
* Replace manual highlighting with a SyntaxHighlighter
* Simplify getGazeboCompatibleURDF()
  Use a new utility function uniqueInsert() to avoid code duplication
  when inserting XML elements uniquely.
* getGazeboCompatibleURDF(): Compare original and final XML
  Instead of manually keeping track of changes, compare the two docs.
  This is much more robust.
* getGazeboCompatibleURDF(): Skip catching YAML exceptions
  There is no YAML involved!
* fixup: config_path\_ -> static const CONFIG_PATH
* fixup: Simplify saving
  - new_gazebo_urdf\_ -> save_gazebo_urdf\_
  - directly save content, avoid extra parsing
  - hide overwrite button if doc is empty
  - disable overwrite button if saving is not possible due to xacro

  but (re)create the list of to-be-generated files each time
  entering the widget to allow for dynamic adaption of the file list
* fixup: Improve message boxes

  Implement ACM defaults as a fallback instead of an override.
  Based on `ros-planning/srdfdom#97 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/97>`_, this allows disabling collisions for specific links/objects by default and re-enabling individual pairs if necessary.

  Co-authored-by: Robert Haschke <rhaschke@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de>

  * Update bind include header
  grep -rlI --exclude-dir=.git "boost/bind" | xargs sed -i 's#boost/bind.hpp#functional#'
* MSA: Notice file updates (`#2964 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2964>`_)
  This commit fixes a MSA bug causing files in a loaded MoveIt config to be incorrectly classified as externally modified
  after being written by the "Generate Package" button.
  As this status is solely based on the file timestamp relative to the timestamp stored in the .setupassistant file,
  we need to update this timestamp when we wrote the files.
* Upload controller_list for simple controller manager (`#2954 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2954>`_)
* 1.1.6
* Various improvements to MSA: `#2932 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2932>`_, `#2945 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2945>`_, `#2946 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2946>`_
* Pilz: Define default planner
* Simplify definition of `planning_plugin` parameter
  There is no means to declare the planning_plugin as an arg first.
* Allow checking/unchecking multiple files for generation
* Improve instructions
* moveit.rviz: Use Orbit view controller
* moveit.rviz template: remove link names
* Rename launch argument execution_type -> fake_execution_type
  ... to clarify that this parameter is only used for fake controllers
* gazebo.launch: delayed unpause
  Only unpause simulation when robot model was loaded.
  This ensures that the initial pose is actually held.
* gazebo.yaml: Allow initial_joint_positions
* gazebo.launch: Load URDF via xacro if neccessary
* Modularize demo_gazebo.launch: draw on demo.launch
* demo.launch: start joint + robot-state publishers in fake mode only
  This will facilitate re-use of demo.launch.
* Formatting
* Fix controller choice
  - Provide all types of JointTrajectoryController as well as
  FollowJointTrajectory and GripperCommand (use by simple manager)
  - Use effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController as default
  - Create FollowJointTrajectory entries for any JointTrajectoryController
* Simplify code
* Update widget texts to speak about generic controllers
* Rename ROSControllersWidget -> ControllersWidget
* Rename files ros_controllers_widget.* -> controllers_widget.*
* Rename ros_controllers_config\_ -> controller_configs\_
* Rename functions *ROSController* -> *Controller*
* Rename ROSControlConfig -> ControllerConfig
* Fix ros_controllers.yaml: always handle joints as sequence
* Rework controller config generation
  We should write separate controller config files for different controller managers:
  - simple_moveit_controllers.yaml handles everything relevant for SimpleMoveItControllerManager
  - ros_controllers.yaml handles ros_control config
  - gazebo_controllers.yaml handles controllers required for Gazebo
* Add gazebo_controllers.yaml
* Fix handling of sensors_3d.yaml
  - Reading both, the default and the existing package's sensors_3d.yaml
  into the config, the config file was growing by 2 configs each time.
  - Not visiting the Perception tab, was writing the default config with 2 entries
  - Selecting "None" was writing an invalid config:
  sensors:
  - {}
  - {}
* Cleanup generation of ros_controllers.yaml
* Rework moveit_controller_manager handling
  There are 3 basic MoveIt controller manager plugins:
  - fake = `moveit_fake_controller_manager::MoveItFakeControllerManager`
  Used in demo.launch. Doesn't really control the robot, but just
  interpolates between via points. Allows these execution_types:
  - via points: just jumps to the via points
  - interpolate: linearly interpolates between via points (default)
  - last point: jumps to the final trajectory point (used for fast execution testing)
  - ros_control = `moveit_ros_control_interface::MoveItControllerManager`
  Interfaces to ros_control controllers.
  - simple = `moveit_simple_controller_manager/MoveItSimpleControllerManager`
  Interfaces to action servers for `FollowJointTrajectory` and/or `GripperCommand`
  that in turn interface to the low-level robot controllers (typically based on ros_control)
  However, so far move_group.launch distinguished between `fake` and `robot` only.
  The argument moveit_controller_manager now allows switching between all 3 variants.
  Adding more *_moveit_controller_manager.launch files allows for an extension of this scheme.
* Fix definition of real-robot moveit_controller_manager
  Fixes the following error (occurring since 61d18f2f073aa4c8a13c2278c41a63591d401c4a)
  ```
  [FATAL] ros.moveit_ros_planning.trajectory_execution_manager:
  Exception while loading controller manager 'robot':
  According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class robot
  with base class type moveit_controller_manager::MoveItControllerManager does not exist.
  ```
  As we introduced `pass_all_args="true"`, the value of the argument
  `moveit_controller_manager` was the robot name.
* Remove execution_type argument from real-robot controller_manager.launch
* moveit_controller_manager.launch: pass execution_type via pass_all_args (`#2928 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2928>`_)
  While we need to pass execution_type to fake_moveit_controller_manager.launch,
  the controller_manager.launch files of real-robot shouldn't be required
  to define this argument. However, if they don't roslaunch fails with an
  `unused args` exception (see `#2786 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2786>`_).
  Passing arguments via pass_all_args should solve that issue.

  * Fixes `#841 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/841>`_
* Merge https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/commit/a0ee2020c4a40d03a48044d71753ed23853a665d
* moveit_build_options()
  Declare common build options like CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE,
  and compiler options (namely warning flags) once.
  Each package depending on moveit_core can use these via moveit_build_options().
* Load all planning pipelines into their own namespace (`#2888 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2888>`_)
  Reduce code redundancy, specifying the namespace once in planning_pipeline.launch.
* MSA: Correctly state not-found package name
  The warning message was accessing the config_data\_ variable, which
  was assigned just a few lines later.
