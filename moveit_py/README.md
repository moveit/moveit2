## Notes on Python Bindings Modifications

1. `planning_interface::MotionPlanResponse` does not have the `start_state` and `planner_id` attributes. I commented out the related property definitions with their setters and getters.

2. In `planning_scene.cpp`, the method `PlanningScene::setAllowedCollisionMatrix` was not implemented in `moveit_core::planning_scene`. I copied the implementation, but since full compilation would be required, I commented out the setter method and replaced it with a read-only version.

3. In `trajectory_tools`, newer versions include `applyTOTGTimeParameterization`, which is not available here. It applies the Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation; currently commented out, but we could copy the implementation if needed.

4. In `planning_scene_monitor.cpp` (part of `moveit_ros`, now in `moveit_py`), `process_attached_collision_object` and `process_collision_object` were defined but are not actual methods of `PlanningSceneMonitor`â€”only of `PlanningScene`. Consider implementing them in `PlanningSceneMonitor` as well.

5. In `moveit.cpp`, `moveit/utils/logger.hpp` was used, but it no longer exists. It seems only `rclcpp`'s logger is now used. I followed the logging pattern from other modules.

6. In `trajectory_execution_manager`, commented out the `execution_duration_monitoring` getter and other missing getters that are not defined in the `.h/.cpp` files.

7. In `planning_component.hpp`, removed all references to `MultiPipelinePlanRequestParameters` and `plan` branches based on `single_plan_request_param`; retained only `parameters` as done in MoveIt 2.

8. In `planning_component.hpp/.cpp`, `plan()` used to return a `planning_interface::MotionPlanResponse`, but in Humble it returns a `moveit_cpp::PlanningComponent::PlanSolution`. Although `MotionPlanResponse` still exists in `planning_response.hpp`, the Python equivalent for `PlanSolution` is missing and needs to be implemented and exposed via bindings.

9. In `initPlanRequestParameters`, the method call `params.load(node, ns)` includes `ns`, which was not used or present in Humble. Needs clarification on how namespaces are now handled for parameter loading.

10. In `controller_manager`, `:py:class:\`moveit_py.controller_manager.ExecutionStatus\`` documents the execution status. \\ TODO(@samu): verify the actual return type from the module.
