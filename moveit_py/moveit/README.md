# Stubfile Generation
What is a stub?

```
A stub file in Python is a file that is used to define type hinting information (.pyi file extension).
This type hint information enables users to interactively retrieve data about a method or class within their chosem IDE.
```

For this project we leverage (stubgen)[https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html] from the (mypy)[https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html]
Python package to autogenerate stub files. To do so we simply build the moveit_py Python library and run the following command from an environment containing the built package:

```
stubgen -p moveit
```

This outputs the outgenerated stub files to an `out` directory. These are the stub files we use.

Note: manual edits are likely to be made to the autogenerated files for official library releases.](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
